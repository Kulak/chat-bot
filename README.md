# README

A quick research project on how to put together a `chat-bot` react application.

The goal is to use current React features and not to use other dependencies.

The project consists of backend and frontend parts.

Backend simply serves pre-canned data.

Frontend is the core effort of this project. It relies on current version of React with

- hooks
- context

The code is structured to start using application level state with either

- built-in reducer (might require some work)
- or MobX.  MobX friendly setup.

STATUS: as is without any future plans.
